This mod was inspired by coryinthedank's Zoom+ mod. If you want, you can check out his mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1781410139).

I wrote this mod to provide configuration options for the camera as well as to reduce how far down the Knobbly Tree leaves are on the screen.
